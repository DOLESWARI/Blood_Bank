Donor report e two ways to generate report;

1> generate report w.r.t dname or state
	==> for these after selecting any row from the tree view the generate report button will become active otherwise will be disabled 
2> generate the whole report w.r.t the whole transactions seen in the page
	==>for these no need to select any row from the tree view,pdf will bw generated for the whole (i.e.==>states under states the dname ,did ,blood_qty,date etc.) 



for (2) option:::
1st w.r.t the states counted no of did
by using group by function to count no of times states repeated

o/p=>[('BIHAR', 1), ('DELHI', 1), ('HIMACHAL PRADESH', 2), ('JAMMU KASHMIR', 3), ('ODISHA', 1), ('UTTARAKHAND', 1), ('WEST BENGAL', 2)]
     number= 7

2nd in the range of length of states printed the states seperatedly not in the list which is done when taken from database and printed in the list of lst
m=0
lst[m][n]=> prints state
n=n+1
print(lst[m][n])=> prints the count value
m+1=> for the nxt value within the list

o/p=>   BIHAR
	1
	DELHI
	1
	HIMACHAL PRADESH
	2
	JAMMU KASHMIR
	3
	ODISHA
	1
	UTTARAKHAND
	1
	WEST BENGAL
	2

lst = self.c.execute("select state,count(*) from donor group by state")
lst = [row for row in lst]
print(lst)
print("number=",len(lst))
m=0
for i in range(len(lst)):
  n=0
  print(lst[m][n])
  n=n+1
  print(lst[m][n])
  m=m+1
        

3rd after getting the states and the no of entries per state seperately 
now need to calculate no of donations done by every individual in the state

lst = self.c.execute("select state,count(*) from donor group by state")
lst = [row for row in lst]
print(lst)
print("number=",len(lst))
m=0
for i in range(len(lst)):
	n=0	
	print(lst[m][n])
	name_lst = self.c.execute("select did,dname,state from Donor where state=?",(lst[m][n],))
	name_lst = [row for row in name_lst] 
	print(name_lst)
	n=n+1
  	print(lst[m][n])
  	m=m+1

o/p =>  HIMACHAL PRADESH
	[('Did007', 'subhendhu', 'HIMACHAL PRADESH'), ('Did012', 'Raima Das', 'HIMACHAL PRADESH')]
	
same will be the output for other for the xtra part written over here

4th is to now seperate out the value of did from the list of tuples ---->i.e.[('Did007', 'subhendhu', 'HIMACHAL PRADESH'), ('Did012', 'Raima Das', 'HIMACHAL PRADESH')]
for that nested loop is required-->to diffentiate the did value(working with did value bcoz it is only unique key
then again from database take the blood qty,date state dname all the values from two tables(donor,donation) to print those values in the pdf
